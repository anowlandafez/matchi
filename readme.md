##Pin User
Users will be able to test this use case by logging into the application and viewing a list of matches. They should then be able to click on a match's 'pin' icon, which will then bring up a notification telling them they have pinned this user.
##Block User
Similar to Pin User, users will test this by logging into the application and viewing their matches. They can then click on a match's 'block' icon, which will then bring up a notification telling them they have blocked the user. 
##Unblock User
The user will be able to do this through their profile page, where they can view their blocked list of matches. They will have the option to click on an 'unblock' icon next to the blocked user which will confirm they are unblocking the user. The user will then be removed from the blocked list. 
##Unpin User
The user will be able to do this through their profile page, where they can view their pinned list of matches. They will have the option to click on an 'unpin' icon next to the pinned user which will confirm they are unpinning the user. The user will then be removed from the pinned list.
